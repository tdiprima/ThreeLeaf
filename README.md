## ThreeLeaf

Our objective here is the seamless integration of: [leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/), a JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps and [three.js](https://threejs.org/), a cross-browser JavaScript library/API that is primarily used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics on a Web browser.

Our key focus will be on the script - [PaintPolygon.js](https://github.com/tcoupin/leaflet-paintpolygon) which is central to our purpose.

It is crucial to note that several examples cited herein might be derivative of other sources, primarily the repositories aforementioned. In case you detect your contribution within these, kindly notify me so that I can duly acknowledge your input.
